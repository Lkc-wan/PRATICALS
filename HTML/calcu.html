       </h1>
    <p><b>Calculus</b>, a branch of Mathematics, developed by<i><b>Newton and Leibniz</b></i>, deals with the study of the rate of change. clculas define formula like f(2)<sup>n</sup> CM is generally used in Mathematical models to obtain optimal solutions. It helps us to understand the changes between the values which are related by a function. Calculus Math mainly focused on some important topics such as <b>differentiation, integration, limits, functions,</b> and so on. Scientific calculation provide formilas like: H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub></p>
